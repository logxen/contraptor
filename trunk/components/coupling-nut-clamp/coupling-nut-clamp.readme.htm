<h3>Overview</h3>
<span class="inline right"><a href="/user/albanetcsr/photos/dsc03976"><img src="http://www.garagefab.cc/files/images/DSC03976.half.JPG" alt="" title=""  class="image half" width="320" height="240" /></a></span>
<p>
The coupling nut clamp is the angle stock with three pairs of 7/64&quot; holes in it. Two pairs and four screws are used to clamp 1/4&quot; coupling nut, and one pair is used to attach the clamp to the lead nut mount. 
</p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>
Aluminium angle, 1&quot;x1&quot;, 1/8&quot; thick<br />
Coupling nut 1/4&quot;, 7/8&quot; long, 3/8&quot; wide<br />
Machine screws 6-32, 3/8&quot;
</p>

<h3>Making</h3>
<p>
Make the angle piece from SVG or PDF template, according to the instructions in Howto section. 
</p>
<p>
Tap the holes with 6-32 tap.
</p>
<p>
In the side with one pair of holes, intall two screws from the inside out. Saw off their ends on the outside and deburr. Place the coupling nut flat against the opposite side of the clamp (with two pairs of holes). Where the nut touches screw heads, the heads need to be filed slightly so that the nut could be slid a little further into the corner. After filing, install two screws near the centerline and place the nut in the same position in between these screws. Mark where the remaining two screws will go into the edge of the nut and file two notches there. Put the nut back, install the remaining pair of screws and remove the pair from the centerline. The nut should be securely clamped.
</p>
<p>
Screw the clamped nut onto the threaded rod and install it into the lead nut mount. Check that the rod can rotate, if not - you'll have to use shorter screws to attach clamp to the lead nut mount (or just shorten them with a file).
