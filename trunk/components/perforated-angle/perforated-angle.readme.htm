<h3>Overview</h3><span class="inline right"><a href="/user/albanetcsr/photos/dsc03932"><img src="http://www.garagefab.cc/files/images/DSC03932.half.JPG" alt="" title=""  class="image half" width="320" height="240" /></a></span><p>Perforated angle has 1/4&quot; holes, centered and spaced 1&quot; apart. This is the main building block ofthe Contraptor set. The angle is used as a structural component and as a linear rail for sliding elements. Quarter-inch holes, used in the set with smaller 10-24 screws, allow small adjustments at the time of assembly, which makes the design tolerant to errors. </p><p>The raw aluminum angle stock needs to be turned into perforated angle, however it doesn't need to happen all at once. Typically, only a few holes per piece are required for any given project, and so drilling can be spread out over time as different contraptions are built from the set. </p><h3>Materials</h3><p>Aluminium angle, 1&quot;x1&quot;, 1/8&quot; thick</p><h3>Source Files</h3><ul>	<li>This release: components/perforated-angle/	</li>	<li>Latest version: <a href="http://contraptor.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/contraptor/trunk/components/perforated-angle/" title="http://contraptor.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/contraptor/trunk/components/perforated-angle/">http://contraptor.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/contraptor/trunk/components...</a> 	</li></ul><h3>Making</h3><p>The process is pretty simple - attach the templates to the angle, saw it into pieces, center punch the holes, remove the templates.</p><p>This approach can be used for making all of the perforated angle, or just enough to build a drill press jig, which can then be used to drill more perforated angle. This can work if you don't want to drill the holes as you go and would rather take the time to do it upfront. </p><p>The template labels are located in the SVG file. There is also a copy in PDF if SVG can't be read or printed. The labels are 9&quot; long and need to be attached to the angle one after another. Depending on your printer and accuracy of the cutouts, the actual printed labels may not be exactly 9&quot; long, so before you attach the labels, measure and mark with a pencil exact 9&quot; intervals on the angle, which should add up to the length of 9&quot; x number_of_intervals. Attach the labels as described in the Howto section, steps 1-5. Basically, you want the hole marks to closely match the inch marks on the measuring tape across the entire angle span (usually 3, 4 or 8 ft). </p><p>Once the labels are attached, saw the angle into pieces as required. After sawing, you'll want to center punch all holes in the pieces that will be used as linear rails, remove the labels from them using adhesive remover, and then use sandpaper or file to flatten the marks from center punch.  The labels can stay on all other pieces until they are completely drilled - or you may choose to center punch and remove labels from them as well, though this will take more time. </p>Center punch accurately as this will be your only drillingguide after the labels have been removed. Do NOT center punch with the angle secured in the vise - this will shiftthe labels.<p>Drill 1/4&quot; holes on as needed basis, using the marks from the center punch.</p><br class="clear" /><div id="node-819" class="section-4">

			1. To make perforated angle with a drill press, you'll need a template -
			an already made perforated angle 24&quot; long. The template has to be
			accurate. The template will be secured in the vise using T-profile pair of 6&quot; angle pieces.

			2. Bolt the middle of the template to this pair (forming incomplete
			X-profile) and insert some thin wire (0.02&quot; or so) closer to
			the edge before tightening. Aluminum angle
			profile is slightly less than 90
			degrees. When four angles are placed together, there will
			be a small gap. This can result in errors, hence the wire to fill the gap.

			3. Secure the template in the vise. There should be no gaps when you place the angle to the template, otherwise go back to step #2. Install bolts to fix the vise to the table. Two 1/2&quot; bolts are used here. Do not tighten yet.

			4. Using 2 screws, attach a known true angle to the template and manually rotating the drill bit, position the vise so that the bit goes exactly into the hole. Be sure the bit is not bent. Once positioned, tighten the bolts. This may take more than one attempt.

			5. You may want to test out the positioning on a scrap piece of angle. Drill the hole and measure the distance to the edges with a caliper the 1/4&quot; hole should be roughly in the center of the angle (within Â±1/64&quot;). Depending on the results, you may need to repeat step #4. And yes, the angle piece should be clamped.

			6. Once the hole is centered, flip the angle over and test whether the opposite holes match up. This can be checked with a piece of square tube pushing against the screw in one of the holes - the edge of square tube should match up with the other hole. Depending on the results, you may need to repeat step #4.

			7. Once the template is secured in the right position, and the first hole is drilled, it's fairly easy to flip over the angle, attach it to the template - preferrably in two places far apart - and continue drilling.
